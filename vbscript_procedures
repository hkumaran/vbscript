Types of Procedures in VBScript
A procedure is a block of code that ideally performs a single function. A block of code that processes an input or handles a file is a good example of a function. There are two types of procedures in VBScript.
1. Sub procedure: The sub-procedure does not return a value.
2. Function procedure: The function procedure is used if you want to return a value.

----Sub Procedure------
title="Hello Everyone"
call saysub(2,title)
Sub saysub(x,y)
 msgbox "Welcome",x,y
end sub	


-----Function Procedure ------
egreturn()
Function egreturn()
	egreturn=3
	call SayFunction(egreturn)
End Function
Function SayFunction(x)
	msgbox "Welcome to Knowinsideout",x
End Function
